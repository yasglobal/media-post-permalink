Media Post Permalink is simply the easiest solution to separate your media/attachment Permalinks.

== Description ==
When Any media is uploaded in WordPress, by default wordpress creates the attachment(post) against it and set it's permalink using the post name (media name). 

This plugin helps:

* To add some prefix in all the Media/Attachments when you added/updated it.
* To add some suffix in all the Media/Attachments when you added/updated it.
* To add both prefix as well as suffix in all the Media/Attachments when you added/updated it.
* Remove Parent Post (Parent Post adds it's permalink in the Media Permalink so, by this feature, None of the media would contains it's parent post).
* Make the Permalinks User Friendly.

Advantages:

* Adding prefix/suffix or both would help you to distinguish your attachment posts from the other posts.
* Your Media doesn't reserve any permalink. Like, if you upload the image named services.png so, services permalink reserved by the Media/Attachment Post. By using this plugin, it won't happen anymore.
* Your Permalinks would be user Friendly. Underscore doesn't be allowed anymore.

You can define your own prefix and suffix from the settings page. By default, they are empty(Null). You can also choose whether you want to remove the Parent Post or not and whether you want the user-friendly Permalink or not.

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install the plugin is to use the WP built-in menu for finding and installing new plugins directly from the WordPress repositories.

If you need to install this using FTP or SFTP, you should follow these steps:

1. Upload `media-post-permalink` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory using your favorite FTP client.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Apply the settings as per your requirements.
4. That's it.
